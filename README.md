# AutoBlur

A Python tool for automatically blurring faces and/or logos in photos and video.

## Motivation

This project will be mainly for improving my Python development and for practicing applying machine learning to photo and video files. I hope to implement pretrained models in addition to training and potentially implementing my own models.

Eventually this tool should be able to recognize faces and/or logos in a photo or video file and automatically blur them.

## Progress

I will update this readme as the development progresses... right now there isn't much to see.
